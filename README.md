Instagram like clone photo gallery social media project

### 
This is a very basic instagram like clone project that enables the user to upload pictures that are stored in firestore and displayed from the database configured for this project

The user has the ability to upload their pictures and view them only. The login authentication has not been enabled for this project due to time constraints but there is a responsive progress bar, upload feature, and display feature for the pictures. 

Though it is bad practice, there are no rules set up within the database and the storage to restrict who can upload to the application database. That is a feature I planned on implementing but ran out of time for so I chose to get the app fully functional and tested. 

The login feature is something I will be adding as soon as I can.
